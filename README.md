# Blog Website

A blog website made using TypeScript, Vue, and Tailwind CSS. Uses [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for storing posts between views and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for fetching from the corresponding [REST API project](https://github.com/JoeZlonicky/blog-api). You can also check out the corresponding [admin dashboard project](https://github.com/JoeZlonicky/blog-admin) that is also made in Vue.
